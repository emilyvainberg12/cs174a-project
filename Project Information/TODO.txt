• Full Day cycle will last 1 minute(60 seconds)
• Maybe add crouching feature(have to crouch under obstacles)
    - instead of crouch use shrink to use scaling properties
Advanced Feature: background changing (time of day)
    Shadows change as the sunlight changes
    At the end of the day we have a super starry night and player and collect lots more starts -> maybe if needed 

CHARACTER 
running annimation for character
Possibly have character move up and down as well so that he can dodge an object in any of the 4 directions
